/// This function:
/// 1. Finds all swap jobs in Pending status older than SWAP_JOB_TIMEOUT_NS
/// 2. Marks them as Failed with an appropriate error message
/// 3. Creates claims for fund recovery
/// 
/// This ensures that if kong_rpc fails to report back (network issues, crashes, etc.),
/// users can still recover their funds through the claim system.
